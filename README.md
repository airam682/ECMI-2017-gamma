# ECMI-2017-gamma
This is the repository for TeX files of the report. The guidelines for the report will be stated below (as they were given by the ECMI report template),
this may change to the authors discretion.

## Introduction
The actual research report is opened with an introduction. The purpose of the intro-
duction is to introduce the topic and awaken the reader's interest. The introduction
brie?y describes the background, material extent and aims of the work. The intro-
duction presents the research methodology applied. It also describes the key points
and organisation of the document (which section includes what). It does not, however,
include detailed descriptions of the theory, methods or results.

## Report content
After the introduction there follows the actual content of the report follows. Depending
on the project, the document may need to include some theoretical section with pre-
sentation of methods used in the practical implementation. Then the implementation
details (techniques, methods, software, etc.) should be given, followed by the work
results.

The language of the report must be grammatically correct and the expression coher-
ent, accurate and concise. The topic must be presented to the reader unequivocally,
intelligibly and consistently. The style must be academic and the technical terminology
established. In particular, the use of foreign words should be avoided. They should be
replaced with paraphrases or expressions in the language of the thesis.

The entire document should follow the typical scientific writing rules, that is:
  + Every figure and table needs to be properly numbered and captioned.
  + Every figure and table that appears in the document has to be explicitly referred to (by its number) in the text, for the first time always before the actual figure/table is presented.
  + The recommended figure file format is *.eps and *.pdf or *.png (when neither *.eps nor *.png is not possible).
  + The font size in the figures (labels, legend, etc.) should be comparable to the main text font.
  + Equations should be well formatted/aligned and numbered and, where necessary, explicitly referred to by their numbers.
  + The text should be aesthetically typed in, with spaces between words and punctuation marks formatted with respect to the international typing standards.
  + References should have full bibliographic data required respectively to each publication type.
  + Every bibliography item listed under references should be cited explicitly in the text.
  + The style of all bibliography items should be unified.

In order for the observations to be of use to others, the stages of the research work
must be presented in complete and the results of the observations in their original
form in e.g. tables. Long sequences of equations and programming code are appended
with headings. It is not necessary to show the derivation of the equations quoted, al-
though the author must make sure the equations are presented correctly. However, the
derivation of new expressions and equations introduced in the thesis must be shown, at
least in outline. The author must also explain under which conditions the calculations,
formulae and equations are applicable.

# Discussion and conclusions

Depending on the nature and scope of the study, the report ends either with the chapter
"Conclusions", or two separate chapters, e.g. "Discussion" and "Conclusions". In the
discussion, the author relates all of the material he or she wishes in reply to the research
questions posed. Repetition with respect to the text in the report's main content should
be avoided unless it is necessary. However, the discussion must be drawn up in such
a way that a professional in the ?eld can repeat the research work e.g. to check the
equations, expressions, measurements, calculations or results and conclusions.
The conclusions analyse the observations and results drawn from the research, as well
as examine and re?ect on e.g. the compatibility of the theory and measurements, the
reasons for possible di?erences, and summarise the conclusions drawn from the results.
The need for further research and possible practical applications may also be argued
here.

# Group work dynamics
The student group should write an assessment of the group work dynamics (including
both the Modeling Week time itself and the time/workload afterwards, spent on writing
the report itself). In particular, you should at least answer to the following questions:
• How did you plan the work?
• How was the work distributed between the partners?
• What was bene?cial or challenging about the group work?

# Instructor's assessment
Every instructor is asked to add a brief (1-2 paragraph) summary of how the group has
performed through the week, especially with respect to the problem's initial goals and
the actual achievements. Here is also the place to report possible total or part-time
absences of the students during the group work hours - these can be also reported by
the fellow group mates.
